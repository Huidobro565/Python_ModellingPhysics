'''terminas speed for a skydover is 60m/s , calculate how far
and how long does it take to reach this speed in free fall'''
'''something interesting here is that the air density
(air density at altitude H is exp(-H/8500) * rho_airsealevel)
would vary with altitude, which means that in brutally real life,
this would involve differential equations, however this is just an
approximation.
Also note that no contraints were given in this problem, no
initial altitude, weigth, surface area of body, etc.
